This is a beta preview of GUESS, most of the functions are not exposed
through the UI but you can give it a quick try.

To get running just modify the GUESS_HOME variable in guess.bat or
guess.sh to point to where you have guess installed and run it.

As of version 1.0.2 the manual and more complete installation
instructions are available at http://guess.wikispot.org
