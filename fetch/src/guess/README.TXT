This is a beta preview of GUESS, most of the functions are not exposed
through the UI but you can give it a quick try.

To get running just modify the GUESS_HOME variable in guess.bat or
guess.sh to point to where you have guess installed and run it.

Take a look at the manual.pdf file for a tutorial and more detailed
installation instructions (including those for a Mac)
