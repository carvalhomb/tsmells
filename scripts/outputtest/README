The OutputTest class found in outputtest.py is meant to facilitate testing
the output of commandline programs. It allows you to simply specify a 
command and the expected output, either directly or through a file. 
Only for processes which finish (ie not for checking interactivly *)

It [ab]uses pythons builtin PyUnit framework, by subclassing 
unittest.TestCase. Two asserts provide the functionality:
  + assertOutputEqual(self, command, expected, message, timeout)
  + assertOutputEqual(self, command, filename, message, timeout)

Example usage:

>import outputtest, unittest
>
>class MyOutputTest(outputtest.OutputTest):
>    def testMyCommand(self):
>        self.assertOutputEqual("mycommand", "expectedOutput")
>
>if __name__ == '__main__':
>    unittest.main()

testOutputTest.py contains some unittests for OutputTest.
sunny.txt and fail.txt are used by those tests. Run them
with ``python testOutputTest.py''


* get expect or pexpect if you want to do that.
