Both Fetch and Guess are now included in the TestQ distribution (from v0.6 onwards)

TestQ v0.6 tarball is available [http://www.lore.ua.ac.be/Research/Artefacts/testQ/testQ-0.6.tgz here]

TestQ includes 3 samples projects: Poco (forked CppUnit), 
ArgoUML (JUnit 3.8) and Anastacia (JUnit 3.8).

Both the Poco and ArgoUML samples require no external tools, other than an up-to-date Shell, Python and Java runtime. Simply run their `./testQ.sh' scripts distributed in sample/$PROJ.

Anastacia however completes a full cycle (as opposed to starting
from a generated model) and thus requires both SourceNavigator and 
CrocoPat executables to be present on your PATH. Please refer to the
excellent [http://lore.cmi.ua.ac.be/fetchWiki/index.php/Installation installation page] on the Fetch wiki for additional 
instructions.
