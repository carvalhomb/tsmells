Some preliminary visualizations of smells in test suites. The 'flowers' represent the different test cases. Nodes connected directly to the center are test commands, red or green colored nodes represent test smells. The edge relation stands for containment;
 * test cases contain test commands
 * test commands contain smells

In the guess-gui one can zoom, investigate extra information and jump to source code.

= Pmd =

A java code style checker with 257 test cases good for 629 commands.

A view of the guess GUI with pmd-3.5 loaded. Actually a fair share of of those
red dots are false positives and should be rooted out ...

= Poco =

[http://pocoproject.org/ Poco] is an open source C++ library good for 240KLOC, of which 50LOC are unit tests.

The upper right cluster is actually a group of test cases with loads of duplicated code between them (green nodes). The single red nodes are all For Testers Only smell instances.
