#summary Some pictures of the effects of this fix

Code clones used to be reported in pairs, so if a piece of code is repeated x times this would result in sum[1..x-1] reports. A horrible case of duplication.
This is fixed now, n-ary code clones get reported only once.

Below is the result of this fix. The first screenshot was taken before, the second after. Both are from the same test suite, obviously. 
You'll have to admit the pre-fix one is visually appealing though.
