#summary Brief explanation on how to run tsmells
#labels Phase-Deploy

Tsmells is composed of 2 parts. 
  * tsmells-dump: Detection of the smells and dump to file
  * tsmells-viz: Graph based visualization of the test suite and smells


Using tsmells boils down to:
  * Extraction of an abstract model for the project under investigation, with fetch
    To generate this RSF model use either *cpp2rsf.sh* or *java2rsf.sh*, found in $FETCH/scripts    
    After running x2rsf.sh on your source root a $PROJNAME.rsf file will be generated. Note that you need to add the correct *xUnit stubs* to your projects source directory, before running x2rsf.sh. Fetch only reports about entities it can see. Stubs for some CppUnit & JUnit versions are included in the $TSMELLS/stubs directory.

  * Detection of the smells
    Run *rsf2tsmell.py*, found in $TSMELLS/scripts. This will find and report smells. Input is the rsf file generated in step 1. Output will be a $PROJNAME.tsmells dump. This contains test suite information as well as the detected smells in a tab seperated format.

  * Transformation to a format readable by guess
    Invoke *tsmells2gdf.sh* transforms the .tsmells dump from the previous step into gdf. Also provide the project source root directory if you want to browse sources through guess. Two files will be generated. $PROJNAME.gdf and $PROJNAME.srcloc, where the second contains a python pickle dump of the test entity source locations.

  * Loading said transformation in guess
    Finally, the *tsmellsviz.sh* script will start guess, initialize the tsmells gui and load the files generated by step3
