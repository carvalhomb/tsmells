	/// This class implements the client-side of
	/// a HTTPS session.
	///
	/// To send a HTTPS request to a HTTPS server, first
	/// instantiate a HTTPSClientSession object and
	/// specify the server's host name and port number.
	///
	/// Then create a HTTPRequest object, fill it accordingly,
	/// and pass it as argument to the sendRequst() method.
	///
	/// sendRequest() will return an output stream that can
	/// be used to send the request body, if there is any.
	///
	/// After you are done sending the request body, create
	/// a HTTPResponse object and pass it to receiveResponse().
	///
	/// This will return an input stream that can be used to
	/// read the response body.
	///
	/// See RFC 2616 <http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2616.html> for more
	/// information about the HTTP protocol.
